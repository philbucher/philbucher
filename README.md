### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Philipp, a developer focused on structural analysis simulations (FEA) at [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/).

I studied **mechanical engineering** (B.Eng.) and **computational mechanics** (M.Sc.), and completed my **PhD** at the Chair of Structural Analysis at the Technical University of Munich â€” [you can check out my thesis here](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1714023/qew7wvxqw5zvhoxf71we76970.dissertation_bucher_final.pdf).

During my PhD, I developed and used the open-source finite element framework [Kratos Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos). Kratos is written in C++ and has a large Python interface, and uses OpenMP and MPI for parallel computing.

I enjoy building things that last - whether itâ€™s contributing to large simulation frameworks or tinkering on smaller side projects. It is very rewarding for me to see how things grow and mature over time. 

Lately, I've been enjoying working with Rust, both professionally and for personal projects.

I am Philipp. Currently I am working as a developer for structural analysis simulations at  [SimScale](https://www.simscale.com/). 

I studied mechanical engineering in my bachelor, computational mechanics in my master and got my PhD at the [Chair of Structural Analysis at the Technical University of Munich](https://www.cee.ed.tum.de/st/startseite/) (check out my thesis [here](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1714023/qew7wvxqw5zvhoxf71we76970.dissertation_bucher_final.pdf)). 

During my PhD I developed and used the open source finite element framework [Kratos Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos). Kratos is written in C++, with an extensive Python interface. It is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS and provides support for OpenMP and MPI parallelization.

Since then I have gotten into developing with Rust, which I use at work and for smaller personal projects.



I am an active developer of 

Besides writing code on a daily basis (check my GitHub stats below), I am involved in the development of the software design of Kratos as a member of the [technical committee](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki/Management-Structure#technical-committee).

For my research I am using Kratos for the simulation of large scale coupled problems such as [wind turbines](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/philipp-bucher-0757b9130_windfors-winsent-windenergy-activity-6783401767519469569-Ebed).

Developing software for numerical simulation in C++ and Python is one of my strengths. I really enjoy the process, including the full cycle with testing and continuous integration as well as the verification and validation of the results.
