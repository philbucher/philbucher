### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Philipp. I am currently a research assistant at the [Chair of Structural Analysis at the Technical University of Munich](https://www.bgu.tum.de/en/st/mitarbeiterinnen/philipp-bucher/) working on my PhD. In my work I am focussing on the simulation of large scale coupled problems such as the [wind turbines](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/philipp-bucher-0757b9130_windfors-winsent-windenergy-activity-6783401767519469569-Ebed).

I am using the open source finite element framework [Kratos Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos) for my PhD work, to which I contributed a lot.

Developing software for numerical simulation in C++ and Python is one of my strengths. I really enjoy the process, including the full cycle with testing and continuous integration as well as the verification and validation of the results.
